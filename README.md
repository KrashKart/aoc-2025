# AOC 2025 :christmas_tree:
A repo containing my code for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about), created by the wonderful [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/).

This is my 3rd year participating and I'm bummed that there's only 12 problems this year, but they're really tricky for me! I've had to draw much inspiration from online sources (bless Reddit) because I'm currently on an exchange study program and don't really feel as good as I used to be at computational problem solving, but I'll try!
